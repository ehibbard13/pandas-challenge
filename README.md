District Summary

Calculated the total number of schools, total number of students, total budget, average math score, 
average reading score, passing math percentage, passing reading percentage, overall passing rate and 
then created a data frame holding all of that data. 

School Summary

Grabbed all the school types, total student count per school, students per school, budget per school, per student budget, 
average test score per school, average reading score per school, students passing math, students passing reading, as well as per school,
and the overall passing rate per school. All the found data was then put into a Data Frame.

Highest/Bottom-Performing Schools

Using the previously found data I put the data in order to find the highest performing schools and the lowest performing. 

Math/Reading Scores by Grade

Using the School Data I grouped the grades and found the mean math and reading scores within those grades.
Then created Data Frames with the newly calculated data. 

Scores by School Spending/Size

These findings were found using bins to catagorize the spending and size compared to the other columns.

Scores by School Type 

Finally using the perviously found data I created a data frame that compared school types.
